# The Global Flow of People 2.0
This repository features the d3 source codes and additional materials that were created in the context of the Project “The Global Flow of People 2.0.”


The folder "Code" contains the source code of an interactive application in the form of a circular migration plot, which was initiated by Nikola Sander at the German Federal Institute for Population Research (BiB). The application visualises data of global migration flows, global refugee flows, and internal flows in Germany for the past 30 years. It was built in 2023 by Clemens Schrammel and Tina Frank at the University of Arts Linz, Department Visual Communication. The code is written in d3 and creates an interactive circular plot of different flows (global migration, global refugees, internal migration in germany) for different time periods.  

The folder "Poster" contains a poster of a circular plot of the top-50 countries with the largest volume of migration between 2015 and 2020 in PDF format in English and German.

The circular migration plots in the application and on the posters have an optimized colour palette, also allowing colour-blind people to better distinguish between regions and flows based on colour differences. Furthermore, the representation of the migration flows was optimized so that the differences between the outgoing and incoming flows can be better recognized.

## Based on
The datavisualisations are based on the Global Migration Data Sheet made in 2013 at the Wittgenstein Centre Vienna by Nikola Sander, Guy J. Abel and Ramon Bauer. It was published as a poster and made public via http://www.global-migration.info/.

The d3 programming of the project „The Global flow of People“ was done by null2 (https://github.com/null2/globalmigration), Andreas Pieper (https://github.com/argl),  Johannes Jörg Schmidt (https://github.com/jo) and published by Science in 2013.
