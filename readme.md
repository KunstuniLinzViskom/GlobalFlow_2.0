# Global Migration Flow 2.0
Unique estimates of migration flows between the top 50 sending and receiving countries.

This datavisualisation in the form of a circular migration plot was initiated by Nikola Sander at the German Federal Institute for Population Research (BiB) to incorporate the latest global migration data with additional data on global refugee flows and internal flows in Germany.

This version was built in 2023 by Clemens Schrammel and Tina Frank at the University of Arts Linz, Department Visual Communication. 
You can find the new version of the interactive d3 programming with a chooser between 3 datasets aswell as a poster provided as a PDF in two languages: german and english.

The circular migration plot has been adapted with an optimized color palette to allow color-blind people to better distinguish the different colors. Furthermore, the representation of the migration flows was optimized so that the differences between the outgoing and incoming flows can be better recognized.
