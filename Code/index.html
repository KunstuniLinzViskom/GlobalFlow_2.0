                Most people move over relatively short distances, such as within
                Europe, Asia and Africa. Emigrants from North America and Europe
                moved to many different destinations across many world regions,
                while people in the Former Soviet Union moved predominantly
                within the same region.

                Europe and the Former Soviet Union are the busiest world regions
                in terms of migration. Compared to the previous period
                (1990-1995), immigration to North America increased the most,
                while movements within South Asia decreased the most.

              <div class="_2000">
                Europe emerges as an important migration hub, with increasing
                immigration from North America, Latin America, and South Asia.
                The Agreement on the Free Movement of People within Europe also
                contributes to rising migration flows within the continent.

              <div class="_2005">
                Asia joins Europe and North America as a third migration hub,
                with emigration from South Asia increasing strongly due to
                soaring demand for labour migrants from India and other South
                Asian countries.

                Migration from West Asia to Europe and also within Europe

                Africa, South Asia and Europe are by far the largest host
                regions for refugees. The largest flows of refugees occur within
                Africa and South Asia. The Fall of the Soviet Union led to
                sizable outflows of refugees to Europe, mostly Germany. The
                origin country of these refugees is classified as “unknown” in
                official statistics until 2002.
              </div>
              <div class="_1995">
                Africa, Europe and South Asia are the centres of refugee
                movements. Compared to the previous period, movements doubled
                within Europe, where there are ongoing conflicts in countries of
                former Yugoslavia. Sizable movements also occurred within the
                former Soviet Union. In contrast, refugee numbers in Africa and
                South Asia decreased moderately.
              </div>
              <div class="_2000">
                Refugee movements within West Asia increase substantially due to
                the war in Afghanistan. The global trend continues to be
                dominated by refugee flows within Africa and to Europe.
              </div>
              <div class="_2005">
                The refugee movements to Europe are lower than in the previous
                period. The refugee flows within West Asia surge due to the war
                in Iraq.
              </div>
              <div class="_2010">
                Due to the armed conflict in Syria, refugee flows in West Asia
                increase even further compared to the previous period. While
                refugees in Africa and South Asia mainly move within the region,
                Europe records more refugees from non-European countries.
              </div>
              <div class="_2015 active">
                Refugee flows within West Asia more than doubled compared to the
                previous period. Syria is an important origin of refugees in
                Turkey, in other countries in West Asia, as well as in Europe.
                Afghanistan is a major origin of refugees in South Asia. South
                Sudan and Myanmar emerge as new key origins of refugees.

                The years after German reunification are characterized by
                sizable migration from East to West. Besides, large cities
                experience net migration losses to the hinterland.
              </div>
              <div class="_1995">
                The suburbanisation trend observed after German reunification
                continues. Especially cities in East Germany lose population to
                adjacent regions. This becomes most evident for Berlin, which
                loses more than twice as many people to adjacent Brandenburg as
                in the early 1990s.
              </div>
              <div class="_2000">
                The largest cities start to gain population through internal
                migration as the suburbanisation trend from the mid-1990s comes
                to an end. Berlin is an exception to this trend: the capital
                city still experiences high outflows to Brandenburg that result
                in a net loss of population.
              </div>
              <div class="_2005">
                The spatial pattern of flows continues to be characterised by
                urbanisation. Cities gain population through internal migration,
                while hinterlands and rural regions record population losses.
              </div>
              <div class="_2010">
                The urbanisation trend of the 2000s comes to an end, although a
                few cities such as Berlin continue to experience population
                gains through internal migration. Many cities experience
                balanced in- and outflows, while other cities like Munich lose
                population.
              </div>
              <div class="_2015 active">
                Large cities experience increasing net migration losses to the
                hinterland, a pattern that is commonly described as
                suburbanisation. Leipzig and other cities in the East are
                noteworthy exceptions to this trend, as they continue to gain
                population through internal migration.
